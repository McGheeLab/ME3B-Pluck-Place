# DeviceInterfaceAMSB Command File with Calibration Support
# This file contains commands for the ME3B Pluck-Place system

# CALIBRATION WORKFLOW:
# 1. Move needle to your desired reference position manually
# 2. Run HOME to set current position as software (0,0,0)
 
 
# Automatically ran by CalibrationCodeAMSB.py:
 LOAD_CONFIG CalibrationConfigAMSB.json   
 GOTO -3560,-18494,0   

# Moves the syringe up to allow stage movement
GOTO 0,0,25                         

# Moves the syringe back down
GOTO 0,0,-25

# Use calibrated well positions with automatic offsets  
# GOTO_WELL A1

# Pick operation - moves syringe volume up 
# PICK 2.5,0,0

# Move to another well position
# GOTO_WELL B2

# Place operation - moves syringe volume down
# PLACE 2.5,0,0

# Manual positioning still works alongside calibration
# GOTO 4,10,-10

# Return to calibrated reference position
# GOTO 0,0,0

# Additional well movements (uncomment as needed):
# GOTO_WELL A2
# GOTO_WELL B1
